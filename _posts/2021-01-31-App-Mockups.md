The next step was to make more realistic-looking mockups. I used a program called <a href="https://www.sketch.com/"><u>Sketch</u></a> (for Mac) to create all the mockups. Here are the results! <!--more-->

## Mockups, Version 1

![Main Menu Screen Mockup v1](/assets/images/blog-kamekurosu/mockup-v1-main-menu-view.png){:class="blogVerticalImagePairRight"}

![Level Begin Splash Screen Mockup v1](/assets/images/blog-kamekurosu/mockup-v1-level-begin-splash-screen.png){:class="blogVerticalImagePairLeft"}
![Crossword Screen Mockup v1](/assets/images/blog-kamekurosu/mockup-v1-crossword-view.png){:class="blogVerticalImagePairRight"}

I basically just took my drawings (from the [last blog post]({% post_url 2021-01-15-Initial-App-Design %})) and used Sketch to make each of these screens. Note that I changed a few things from my initial drawings as I was making these mockups, but overall they are very similar.

## Mockups, Version 2

After I had these mockups done, I got a bunch of feedback from family and friends - thanks so much, guys! This led me to redesign each screen. I eventually settled on the following:

![Splash Screen Mockup v2](/assets/images/blog-kamekurosu/mockup-v2-splash-screen.png){:class="blogVerticalImagePairLeft"}
![Main Menu Screen Mockup v2](/assets/images/blog-kamekurosu/mockup-v2-main-menu-view.png){:class="blogVerticalImagePairRight"}

![Level Begin Splash Screen Mockup v2](/assets/images/blog-kamekurosu/mockup-v2-level-begin-splash-screen.png){:class="blogVerticalImagePairLeft"}
![Crossword Screen Mockup v2](/assets/images/blog-kamekurosu/mockup-v2-crossword-view.png){:class="blogVerticalImagePairRight"}

As you can see, it looks a bit more fluid, has some extra turtle art (thanks, Peter!), and while I didn't change the colors used much, I changed how I used each color to make it pop a bit more.

## Music

While I was getting feedback from friends/family, Isami (my awesome brother-in-law) offered to help out by creating some music and sound effects for the app. He‚Äôs a super musical and creative guy, so I‚Äôm excited to see what he comes up with! Having good music will definitely make the app more appealing to potential users.

## Summary

That's it! This has been a pretty short post - however, a **lot** of effort went into creating these mockups (around 20 hours or so). I'm really happy with how they turned out, though. Now that I have a good idea of how I want the app to look and behave, I can start getting more into the nitty gritty details of coding it up!
