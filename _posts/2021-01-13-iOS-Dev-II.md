What a year 2020 was. Although my goal was to finish that iOS course and start on my own app, life got in the way. I was able to still learn a lot and finished about half of the course early last year. But this year, I made a New Years Resolution to start again where I left off. <!--more-->

And did that resolution pay off! After many nights filled with watching lectures and writing code, I finished the entire course, did some further research on iOS development topics I was interested in, and started to seriously plan out my app!

But then I realized that there was one iOS topic I hadnâ€™t gotten much experience with in the iOS course I had taken: SwiftUI. <!--more-->

SwiftUI is a relatively new iOS framework that Apple released in 2019, replacing UIKit (the older framework which I used in the course). However, most people still use UIKit because it is more mature. Butâ€¦ SwiftUI is the way of the future, so I've decided to build my app in SwiftUI.

That said, only one section of my iOS development course touched on SwiftUI. So I started another course solely focused on learning this new framework. I built a few small example apps and learned the basics. I didnâ€™t go through the whole course, though.

About halfway through, I felt I was ready to venture out on my own.

Finally... let's build my dream app!
