  <!-- Summary -->
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>
    I am a PhD candidate at Northwestern University in my 5th year under the guidance of Dr. Keith Tyo and Dr. Linda Broadbelt.
    Upon graduation, I plan to enter the workforce as a computational biologist developing software, analyzing data, and working with experimentalists to engineer microorganisms to produce useful chemicals sustainably.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm fluent in Python, MongoDB, SQL, and English. I've also written a decent amount of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Swift, and Japanese. I love to learn new technologies and use those tools to address practical needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I currently live in Evanston, IL, which is near Chicago. I prefer to work remotely with some travel.
  </p>

  <!-- Skills -->
  <h1>Skills: What can I do?</h1>
  <h3>Scientific Research & Data Science</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Work with experimentalists to design experiments and perform statistical analyses:</b> I have experience with both frequentist statistics as well as Bayesian statistical modeling.</li>
    <li><b>Build machine learning models:</b> Analyze complex datasets and make predictions. For example, I built a random forest regressor model using scikit-learn to predict chromatographic retention times in order to annotate unknown compounds in a metabolomics dataset.</li>
    <li><b>Work with cheminformatics tools:</b> I have used tools like RDKit and mordred to process, analyze, and interpret chemical data.</li>
    <li><b>Model biological systems:</b> I have used Genome-scale Models (GEMs) to make predictions using cobrapy. I have also developed kinetic metabolic models, using both deterministic (e.g. ODE) and stochastic (e.g. Kinetic Monte Carlo) kinetic modeling approaches.</li>
    <li><b>Write scientific papers and internal reports:</b> Clearly communicate our science to the rest of the world or company. I have been published in PLoS Computational Biology and Current Opinion in Biotechnology.</li>
    <li><b>Give technical talks and training:</b> Provide expertise in computational biology, data science, and metabolic engineering, which I have 5+ years of experience with.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Software Development</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Develop research tools and APIs:</b> For example, I helped develop the <a href="https://minedatabase.ci.northwestern.edu/#/home"><u>MINE Database</u></a>, to unlock new modes of scientific inquiry. I have used flask to build multiple web APIs.</li>
    <li><b>DevOps and Scripting:</b> Create Docker images, deploy to EC2 on AWS using CodeDeploy, set security for incoming/outbound traffic in AWS, bat and bash scripting.</li>
    <li><b>High-Performance Computing:</b> I have used the Slurm Workload Manager to submit jobs on supercomputing clusters. For example, I used the Quest supercomputing cluster at Northwestern University to predict MS2 spectra for millions of compounds in parallel.</li>
    <li><b>Build and query databases:</b> I have experience building and working with MySQL (with sqlalchemy driver) as well as MongoDB (with pymongo driver) databases.</li>
    <li><b>Contribute to frontend development:</b> I'm familiar with vanilla JavaScript as well as basic HTML and CSS. I built this site using Jekyll, HTML, and CSS, for example.</li>
    <li><b>Collaborate using git and GitHub:</b> submit issues, make commits, merge changes, review and submit pull requests, organize issues into projects. I have used git and GitHub for both solo projects as well as collaborative projects.</li>
    <li><b>Communicate and document effectively:</b> I prefer to use numpy-style docstrings in my python code. I also implement best practices, like adding python type annotations and using descriptive variable names. I have used Sphinx to generate API documentation.</li>
    <li><b>Develop iOS applications using SwiftUI:</b> As a side project, I'm currently working on my first iPhone app - a crossword game for Japanese language learners (see blog for details).</li>
  </ul>
